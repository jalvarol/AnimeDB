This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of various data structures such as Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees (BST), and Lists to create a comprehensive application for managing anime character data. The project consists of several components, each illustrating different aspects of these data structures.

**ACDatabase.java**: This file serves as the main interface for managing the anime character database. It integrates the Hash Table and BST to store and manage the character data efficiently.

**AnimeChar.java**: This class defines the structure of the anime character objects, including attributes such as name, series, and other relevant data.

**BST.java**: This file contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. BST is used for storing and sorting anime characters based on specific attributes.

**Hash.java:** This file contains the implementation of the Hash Table data structure using separate chaining to handle collisions. It is used for fast retrieval and storage of anime character data.

**List.java:** This file contains the implementation of a generic list data structure used within the Hash Table for separate chaining.


**<p>Data Structures Used</p>**
**Hash Table:** Implemented using separate chaining for collision resolution. The Hash.java file includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and managing the hash table. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of anime character data.

**Binary Search Tree (BST):** Implemented to store and sort anime character data. The BST.java file includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and in-order traversal to maintain sorted order. This is useful for efficiently managing and querying sorted data.

**List: ** Used within the Hash Table for separate chaining. The List.java file includes methods for adding, removing, and searching elements within the list. This helps in managing collisions within the hash table effectively.

This project provides a comprehensive example of using various data structures to build an efficient and functional application for managing anime character data. It demonstrates the practical applications of hash tables and binary search trees in real-world scenarios.
